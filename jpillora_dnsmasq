##assuming you are in sudo su mode##
Big thanks to the original creator jpillora,

Before you start, please make sure you have set static IP to your VM/server.

First create a file /opt/dnsmasq.conf in the host with the dnsmasq.conf file provided in the repo.


Next Run the following commands to make system up and running:
docker pull muraddevops/jpillora_dnsmasq;
systemctl disable --now systemd-resolved;
docker run --name dnsmasq -d -p 53:53/udp -p 5380:8080 -v /opt/dnsmasq.conf:/etc/dnsmasq.conf --log-opt "max-size=100m" -e "HTTP_USER=foo" -e "HTTP_PASS=bar" --restart always muraddevops/jpillora_dnsmasq;

Access the web portal via the port 5380 of your VM/server's IP for access to live config update and live log data

Thanks again to the original creator jpillora.
